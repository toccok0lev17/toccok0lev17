As a graduate of Software University, I have obtained diplomas and certificates in Web Development, paving the way for my journey to become a Fullstack Web Developer. With years of experience in the field, I have honed my skills in building headless PWA applications and eCommerce websites connected through Rest API and GraphQL to various Content Management Systems.

My expertise lies in utilizing the latest technologies such as React, NextJS, and numerous other libraries to optimize website performance and user experience. With a passion for web development and a strong dedication to staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and advancements, I strive to deliver top-quality solutions to clients and ensure their utmost satisfaction.

In my free time, I enjoy keeping myself physically active by engaging in various sports activities such as football, basketball, and volleyball. I also like to spend time outdoors by going for walks and hiking, which helps me to stay refreshed and energized. Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is crucial to me, and I find that these activities not only keep me fit but also help me to clear my mind and stay focused on my work.
